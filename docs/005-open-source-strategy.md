# Open Source Strategy

## Why Public

- Attract external contributors for backend adapters and benchmark suites.
- Increase transparency and reproducibility for performance claims.
- Encourage ecosystem integration with vLLM and related runtimes.

## Governance (Initial)

- Maintainers: core SGLang + SGLang JAX contributors.
- PR policy: tests required for adapter or metric changes.
- Release cadence: monthly minor releases.

## Contribution Model

- `good-first-issue` for UI and adapter enhancements.
- RFC process for benchmark schema and comparison contracts.
- Public roadmap tracked in GitHub Projects.

## Security and Privacy

- No input data retained by default unless run persistence is enabled.
- Explicit redaction hooks for logs and artifacts.
